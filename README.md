## To Add (Icebox)

- Be able to play full albums instead of just one song at a time.
- When no song is selected and you press play, customize error message (currently rendering "Cannot perform operation; no list was loaded").
- When you select a song that has no lyrics, return "No Lyrics Found, Sad!" even before you press play.
- Simplify Player styling and add more responsive features.
- Redirect Dashboard logo to return to Login page.
- Explore other Spotify API information to render to the screen, or other APIs to pull information including linear notes, song credits, YouTube link, and other articles.
